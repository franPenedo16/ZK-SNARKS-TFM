#  ELAPSED TIME METRICS

## Description
This document summarizes the elapsed execution time for each implementation evaluated in the project. The goal is to compare the time needed to generate zero-knowledge proofs with the same logic (DNI validation, password hashing, Sudoku solving)

| IMPLEMENTATION | ELAPSED TIME  | 
| -----------    | ------------- |
| Circom         |  0.39s        |
| libsnark       |  0.61s        |
| noir           |  0.14s        |
| risc-zero      |  507.85s      |
